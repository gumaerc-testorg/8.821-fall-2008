{{% resource_link "aa178772-0085-497b-9532-4cba25e38fbc" "The String Landscape, Black Holes and Gravity as the Weakest Force" %}}: This is a paper which says something interesting about arbitrarily-weakly-gauged symmetries and black holes.

{{% resource_link "5b2aaf3a-61aa-40bf-905d-c132e7ed4c4d" "UV/IR Relations in AdS Dynamics" %}}: This paper has some thoughtful discussion of the relationship between the radial coordinate of AdS and various energy scales in the field theory.
